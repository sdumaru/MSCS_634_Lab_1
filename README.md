## Lab Purpose

In this lab, I worked with the Walmart Sales dataset in Jupyter Notebook to:

- Load and inspect the data
- Create a scatter plot to explore the relationship between temperature and weekly sales
- Create a line plot to visualize sales trends over time
- Perform data preprocessing steps: handle missing values, detect and remove outliers, reduce and scale features, and discretize variables
- Conduct statistical analysis to evaluate central tendencies, dispersion, and correlation patterns in the cleaned data

## Key Insights

1. **Temperature vs. Weekly Sales**  
   The scatter plot revealed no clear correlation between temperature and sales; most of the variability in weekly sales occurred at moderate temperature levels.  

2. **Sales Trends Over Time**  
   The line plot showed stable sales throughout the year with pronounced spikes during the end-of-year holiday season.

## Challenges and Decisions

- **Scatter Plot Limitations**  
  The scatter plot did not provide a clear relationship between temperature and sales, making it challenging to draw concrete conclusions from that visualization alone. 

- **Handling Missing Values**  
  There were no missing values in the dataset, so median imputation was implemented as a demonstration rather than a necessity.
